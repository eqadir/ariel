## Important
There are three ways to run/test the backend (all rely on GCP project)
1. Run barebones application: *./run_local.sh*
2. Build and run Docker container locally: *./run_local_docker.sh*
3. Deploy onto GCP: *./deploy.sh*

All three need a locally setup gcloud environment
The scripting is intended to be able to use ariel source directly (as opposed to importing it from pip)
